        <p> Hi! My name is Mariam Abuhamra. I'm not really sure what to write here. Don't worry though! You can have lots of fun looking at the <a href="myportfolio.html">portfolio</a> section or the <a href="codinglibrary.html">libraries</a> section. Don't want to? Then you can finish reading this long and completely pointless yet entertaining paragraph about nothing in particular. I'll be sure to upload more about me in the future when I am more interesting. You're probably wondering how I could be possibly more interesting than I already am. You're also probably wondering how interesting I am to begin with since you don't know me. Well I can guarantee you this: all your questions will most probably be answered if you continuing visiting my site and checking for updates. I can also guarantee that I am not telling you this just to increase traffic on my webpage. Actually, I can't guarantee that. For those of you still reading this, I bet you must be very very very bored. Since you decided to dedicate your time to my webpage I will help you with your boredomness by encouraging you to go do something productive. Go do something productive!
